<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>How to bid</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EN-GB>To bid on an item:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_GoBack"></a><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When the listing ends, you'll receive an
email indicating whether you've won the item and an explanation of what to do
next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Changing or retracting your bid</span></b></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>As a general rule, you can't retract
or cancel a bid. Once you place a bid, you agree to pay for the item if you're
the winning bidder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Blocked Bidders </span></b></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>Landlords and agents can make their
listings unavailable to certain bidders that they specify based on certain
criteria, such as whether or not they have references and required duration of
stay.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"'>If you are blocked from a listing and want

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Main Details</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Each bid you place enters you into a
binding contract. All bids are active until the listing ends. If you win a
listing, you’re obligated to purchase the item.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Don't bid on identical accommodation in
different listings if you only want one.  If you win both, you'll be obligated
to pay for both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you’re outbid on accommodation, wait
until the auction has ended before placing a bid on an equivalent property. If
the bidder who won the auction doesn’t complete the transaction for any reason,
you could become the winning bidder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you’re blocked from bidding on a Landlord
or agents listings, you cannot bid using another user ID.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span lang=EN-GB style='color:#0070C0'>Advertisers</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Do you pre-check Landlords and Agents?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It wouldn't be practical (or possible) for
us to check every Landlord or  on the site. We do, however, take the safety of
our users very seriously and we take several measures to prevent scammers from
advertising on RoomAuction or contacting other users. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Placing an advert</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We recommend you place an advert to get the
best from RoomAuction (it's free) so other users know what you're looking for
or offering. There are two types of advert you can choose from - Free Ads and
Bold Ads. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>How do I place an ad?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>To place an ad on RoomAuction, click on
'Place Ad' in the main menu bar. To advertise a room, choose the first category
'Rooms to Rent'. If you have a whole property, choose the second category. You
can then fill in all the details. If you're looking for a room, choose 'Room
Wanted' and fill in the details to let people know what you're looking for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>What's a Bold Ad?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Bold ads appear highlighted in blue on the
search results pages and feature above free listings of the same age. Upgrading
also includes Early Bird access so you can contact all other users (either
those advertising rooms or looking for rooms). Upgrades cost from £10.99 for 7
days - if you have more than one property the upgrade also lets you manage
multiple adverts by buying extra listings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>How do I upload photos to my ad?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>All users can add up to 9 photos to their
advert free of charge. You'll need to be logged in to your account to do this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Here's how it works:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Find the advert you want to add photos to
by selecting 'My Account' and then 'My Ads' on the navigation bar at the top of
the page. (The reference number and title of your current advert will be listed
in the middle of the page with some wording in blue just below it)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>From the list of options in blue select
'Photos'. You'll then be taken to a photo upload screen</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Click the 'Browse' button. This will open a
pop-up window where you can locate and select the photo you want to add</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Highlight the photo you want to add and
click 'open'. This will fill the box next to the browse button with text</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Click the 'upload' button</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once uploaded the photo will appear as a
small image lower down the page.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once you have all your photos uploaded you
can change the order they appear in or add a caption. To change the order of
the photos click and hold a photo and drag it to its preferred position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>How do I edit my advert?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>To edit your advert:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Log in and go to 'My Account'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Click 'My Ads' on the blue navigation bar</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>On the 'My placed ads' screen you'll see a
grey box titled My Offered/Wanted ads, with the reference number and title of
your advert</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Select 'Edit'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The following page is the Edit screen.
You'll be able to change any information surrounded by an edit box. When you've
made all your changes scroll to the bottom of the page and select 'Save'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Your changes will then be made live on the
site within 90 minutes (see&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-GB><a
href="https://www.spareroom.co.uk/content/infowebsitehelp/faq/#advideophotoappearedonthesite"><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>Why hasn't my ad/video/photo
appeared on the site yet?</span></a></span><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;for more on
this).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>What can I say in my ad?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Renting property is subject to
discrimination laws, so it's important to understand what you can (and can't)
say in your room ad. Largely this is down to whether you'll be living in the
property or not, but there's a little more to it than that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>For full details on discrimination when
you're advertising a room&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-GB><a
href="https://www.spareroom.co.uk/content/default/discrimination"
title=Discrimination><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>click
here</span></a></span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>How do I place more than one advert?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you want to have more than one advert
live on the site you'll need to be an upgraded user with extra listing spaces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>You can upgrade at any time - this will
upgrade your free listing to a bold listing. If you need more live listings the
new upgraded status will let you buy additional spaces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Why hasn't my ad/video/photo appeared on
the site yet?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At RoomAuction we take your safety
extremely seriously. That means (unlike most other sites) we do everything in
our power to keep spam and scams off the site. To do this we've built a complex
set of filters that scan every single ad to make sure that there's nothing
fraudulent in it. These filters are updated constantly - after more than a
decade of running flatmate sites we're pretty good at spotting spam and scam
but there are always new tricks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once that's done each ad, photo and video
uploaded to the site is checked manually to make sure the filters haven't
missed anything. As you can imagine this takes time, but don't worry, your ad
will appear on the site shortly after it's uploaded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The upside of this is that there's nowhere
safer online to rent a room or find a flatmate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>How do I deactivate my advert?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>To deactivate your advert:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Log in and go to 'My Account'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Click 'My Ads' on the blue navigation bar</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>On the 'My placed ads' page you'll see all
your adverts with their reference number and title</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Click on 'Deactivate Ad'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>You'll be asked why you are deactivating
your advert. Select the appropriate option</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Note - Deactivating your ad doesn't pause
your upgrade, you'll need to do this separately - see&nbsp;</span><span
lang=EN-GB><a
href="https://www.spareroom.co.uk/content/infowebsitehelp/faq/#pauseorreactivatemyupgrade"><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>How do I pause (or re-activate)
my upgrade?</span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>How RoomAuction works</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Do I need to pay anything?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Anyone can use RoomAuction completely free.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you're looking for a room and want to
contact all adverts straight away, you can choose to upgrade to get early bird
access. If you choose not to upgrade, you'll still be able to contact the blue
bold adverts and ads over 7 days old. Early bird ads are free to contact after
7 days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Free ads appear grey in the listings. If
you choose to upgrade your subscription it means your ad will appear as a blue
bold advert in the listings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>How does the upgrade system work?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>RoomAuction is free to use. The majority of
people who use RoomAuctiondo not upgrade their subscription. Upgraded users can
place Bold Ads, which appear higher up the search results list and generally
receive significantly more enquiries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>How do I upgrade?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once registered, just click on 'My Account'
in the main menu bar then 'Upgrade' in the sub-menu. You can upgrade before or
after placing an ad. If you choose to place your ad first you can also use the
'Upgrade' option on your advert box on the 'My Ads page of your account'. If
you need any help choosing your upgrade, our customer services team will be
happy to help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='color:#0070C0'>Contact</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>How does the contact system work?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>To contact any advertiser just click on
'Email advertiser' to send them a message. If they've provided their number,
click on 'Phone advertiser' to call. You'll find these in the contact box on
the right of their advert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There are four different types of contact
you can receive in relation to your advert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Email Alerts. These are sent by RoomAuction
on a daily basis (if you request them) and notify you of any new adverts placed
that match your criteria. You can click on the link(s) to go straight to the
advert(s) on RoomAuction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Direct replies to your advert from other
users. We'll notify you of any new messages by sending a 'message alert' to
your registered email address, this will contain a link to your RoomAuction
inbox where you can respond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Interest Shown - you'll get these when a
user either clicks the 'show interest' link on your advert or when they save
your advert to refer back to. Interest can be shown by any user to any other
user, regardless of whether they've upgraded or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Telephone calls. You'll only get these if
you choose to include a phone number with your advert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Where do my messages go?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When you contact a RoomAuction user via the
messaging system the following happens:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Your message is sent to the user's
RoomAuction inbox</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We also send an email to their personal
email address to let them know they have a message</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Why is there a delay in sending my
message?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The main reason RoomAuction uses an
in-house messaging system is because it's safe. It means you don't need to give
your email address to anyone until you choose to (and also means your email
can't be collected by automated software and added to spam mailing lists).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By using our own messaging system it also
means we can monitor message content and keep an eye out for scams. That
doesn't mean we read your messages - an automated filter, which we update
regularly, scans messages for any of the tell-tale language used by scammers
and we can quarantine these messages before they're sent. It also means, on the
rare occasions we think a scammer has been sending messages to users, we can
warn anyone they've been in touch with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This does mean there can be a short delay
in your message being sent but don't panic, it just means it's being checked by
our system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Why have I not received a response yet?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Some users check their email and/or log
into RoomAuction less frequently than others - you should be patient and allow
at least 48 hours for a reply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If the user decides, for whatever reason,
that you are unsuitable for the room, they may choose to not respond for fear
of offending. We try to make it easy for people to respond by offering an auto
decline response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Other reasons beyond our control could be a
user supplying an incorrect email address or the room having been let. We send
regular reminders and make it very easy for users to tell us when a room is
taken but not everyone removes their advert in good time. We're constantly
working on better ways to remove adverts earlier to remedy this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>What can I do if I don't receive a
response within 2 days?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The best thing you can do is to try calling
the user (if they've left a number with their advert). Some prefer telephone
contact anyway. Find their ad, then click on &quot;Contact advertiser&quot;,
then &quot;Contact by phone&quot;. Failing that, the best thing to do is to
keep checking the listings. We get new rooms added every day so chances are
there will be plenty more rooms that are suitable for you. Don't wait around
for someone to get back to you - keep looking in the meantime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>How are the RoomAuction listings
ordered?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In broad terms the ads are ranked in this
order:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Featured ads</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>New Today ads</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Bold ads</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Standard ads</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>How do I close my account?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Just call or email us and we'll do this for
you. We can either deactivate the account (so you don't receive any further
contact from us until you're ready) or permanently close your account.</span></p>
